blue-tinamou-grunge

The main executable is ef_test_case_main.py. It is executed with python
When you run it, you will need to insert 2 values. 
1. The date, in form yyyymmdd
2. The number of exercise (1 or 2)

Please, note, that you need a service-account-file.json (your credentials) for the code to run (the current file is empty).

You may also find a requirements.txt file with all the dependencies.

For verification purposes, I have included the following
1. For exercise 1, an SQL query (called query_q1_2). You may find it in ef_queries.py
2. For exercise 2, a python script called ef_exercice2_python.py
